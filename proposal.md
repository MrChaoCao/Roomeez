# Roomeez
Roomeez is a web application designed to help users find roommates.

## Background and Overview
Finding roommates is an informal and daunting process. Finding new roommates is hard and it is hard to know what a stranger is like before living with them.

Roomeez attempts to solve that problem by:
1. Allowing users to search for roommates based on housing needs and compatibility.
2. Users can rate past roommates to let others know how they are as a roommate.
