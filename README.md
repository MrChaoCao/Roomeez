# Roomeez
Roomeez is a web application designed to help users find roommates.

## Background and Overview
Finding roommates is an informal and daunting process, most people don't even know where to start. The fundamental problem is, it is impossible to know how someone is as a roommate before you've actually lived with them.

Roomeez attempts to solve that problem by:
1. Allowing users to search for roommates based on housing needs and compatibility.
2. Users can rate past roommates to let others know how they are as a roommate.

## Functionality & MVP
This app will, at a minimum, satisfy the following criteria with smooth, bug-free navigation:
- [x] New user sign up, sign in, and authentication
- [x] Splash page explaining the site concept
- [x] Dashboard page clearly displays interface options to user
- [ ] Users fill out a survey to establish their needs and interests
- [ ] Users can view profiles of other users
- [ ] Users can view and create groups
- [ ] Users can search for individuals and groups


#### Bonus Features
- [ ] Users can rate past roommates
- [ ] In app chat between users
- [ ] Users/Groups can be filtered by rating
- [ ] Users/Groups can be filtered by match percentage

## Technologies & Technical Challenges
The MERN stack was chosen for this project because
* Its idiomatic nature. Keeping the entire codebase in a single language was a principal aim of the developers.
* React architecture allows for quick prototyping and isomorphic nature
* MongoDB has excellent scalability, flexible data access, and powerful indexing functionality

#### Technical Challenges
* Learning and designing a back-end with a NoSQL database
* Managing the complex collections required for user-user and user-group interaction 

## Implementation Timeline
### Phase 0: Planning (1 days)
* Determine project scope
* Determine MVPs
* Build component hierarchy
* Build component list
* Determine state shape
* Draw wireframes

#### Objectives:
After the end of Phase 1 the core functionality of the app and all the major features will be discussed and reviewed by the whole team. All planning documents will be completed an the overall workflow and project architecture will be set by the team.

### Phase 1: Learn Technologies (1 days)
* Development team will spend the weekend familiarizing themselves with the MERN stack

#### Objectives:
By the end of Phase 1 the dev team will have researched their respective responsibilities and will learn enough about the MERN stack to begin working on their personal assignments.

### Phase 2: Skeleton (3 days)
* User Authentication (Whole team)
* Splash Page (Adrian)
* Dashboard (Chao, Ashil)
* User Show Page (Wyatt)

#### Objectives:
By the end of Phase 2 the skeleton will be completed and the the general site architecture will have been established. User authentication will be completed and the site will be functional to users, though nearly featureless.

### Phase 3: MVP Features (3.5 Days)
* Group Show Page (Wyatt)
* Search (Ashil)
* Create Group (Chao)
* User and Group Indices (Chao, Ashil)

#### Objectives:
The goal of Phase 3 is for the team to finish all the core functionality of the site. Users will be able to use the site to find roommates based on compatibility and form groups with eachother.

### Phase 4: Polishing (0.5 Days)
* Seeding (Whole team)
* Polishing Styling (Whole team)

#### Objectives:
By the end of phase 4 the site will be production ready. All elements will be styled in a consistent and aesthetically pleasing manner. The database will be seeded with enough information to provide a realistic user experience to new and prospective users for the site.

## Plan to acquire users and market share
* Members of the dev team will share the site with friends and family to build an initial userbase.
* The site will be posted on subreddits devoted to big cities (such as /r/sanfrancisco) to generate click through.
* Ads will be purchased on facebook and google to increase clickthrough and conversion rate of new users
